              <p>
                Giraffe is not just a Video Management System even though it
                does that brilliantly.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Giraffe Platform is an easy-to-use cloud based remote tower
                management system capable of being operated by any internet
                enabled device, anywhere.
              </p>
              <p>
                From a single holistic dashboard, you can view all your cameras,
                be alerted to any intrusions and see the overall health of your
                remote CCTV tower.
              </p>
              <p>
                We believe your tower should be easy to setup, control and
                manage and that is exactly what the Giraffe Platform allows you
                to do.
              </p>
              <p>
                From an internet browser you can view or play back your cameras,
                control the siren, speaker, floodlight & strobe from the same
                screen as managing your team permissions. You can view all your
                towers from different sites in a single location.

              All of your remote CCTV systems, old or new, can be connected to
              the Giraffe platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is a web-based SaaS platform that allows you to control and
              configure all of your towers from one place.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can see how much power the solar panels are currently
              generating and how much power is left in the batteries.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are having problems, you can remotely diagnose, reboot, or
              reset devices remotely.
            </p>
            <p>

                Instead, you need instant access to live and recorded videos
                from any device, anywhere in the world. With the Giraffe
                Platform you'll be able to tilt, pan, and zoom your cameras, see
                live video, record video, get alerts and notifications, and
                manage your entire suite of cameras from anywhere.
              </p>
              <p>
                Not only can the camera be used for security but general
                surveillance and project management too.

                Too many organizations fail to implement surveillance because
                they're worried about cameras breaking, wires going bad or it
                just plain not working. Those concerns are over. With the

                  <p class="fw-medium">
                    Some organisations require private clouds for a host of
                    reasons. They are deployed when public clouds are
                    inapproaite or inadequate for business needs, given the
                    organisation risk tolerance. Giraffe supports a zero trust,
                    high security approach.

            <h2>Better Analytics</h2>
            <p>Are you fed up of false detections from your “AI”?</p>
            <p>
              These are often caused as the processors in the built in analytics
              on board most cameras mean they have to do the analytics on a low
              resolution image. It might work in a lab but not on a buliding
              site in the rain 6m up in the air.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our analytics are done onboard using a state of the art Google
              Coral Processor, designed for the purpose of AI and people
              detection. No longer do you have to put up with false detections
              when a traffic cone is blown across the image. Only get detections
              when you want them making it more likely you’ll catch someone when
              you really need to.

            <h5>Cloud Connected Recording</h5>
            <p>
              The Giraffe Platform has a state of the art hybrid recording
              platform built in. Not only can you view your cameras live but you
              can play them back and download any of the footage in HD from any
              internet connection in any internet browser
            </p>
            <p>
              The footage is stored locally on the tower but is played back
              through the cloud giving you ultimate flexibility to view your
              recordings from anywhere without the cost of storing them in the
              cloud. If you would like cloud back up, we do this too.
            </p>
            <p>
              No longer do you have to wait hours trying to find an event.
              <br />
              See tower events on the timeline and quickly review snapshots to
              drill down into exactly what happened and when.

            <p>
              You can control the tower manually, but it’s more powerful if it
              can take automated actions when it senses something is amiss.
            </p>
            <p>
              Battery operated PIR sensors can trigger PTZ presets which will
              allow you to cover a much larger area with a single tower.
            </p>
            <p>
              The AI can trigger siren, strobe, floodlight or speaker
              activations when a vehicle or person is detected moving as well as
              sending alerts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Schedules can be configured to automatically arm and disarm the
              system, or turn the floodlights on overnight.

              much power we needed to run our CCTV tower all year round. In this
